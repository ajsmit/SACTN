1. Produce the data files (*.csv format) that will allow one to reproduce the graphs in the /graphs folder. This will be the monthly climatologies per
	a. each SACTN site;
	b. each of the interpolated grid pixels (i.e. in insitu_polyMap_sa_Annual_v3.3.pdf);
	b. at each of the 58 sites as per tempssa_v3.0/coords_to_extract/58sites.csv.
2. Produce a .csv with the coordinates, above.
3. Produce R scripts to draw the graphs in 1.
4. For the climatologies in 1, produce a .csv of the summary statistics (n, SD, mean, median, 5th and 95th percentiles, start date, end date).
