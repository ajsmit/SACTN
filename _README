The structure for this project was constructed with the package 
'ProjectTemplate' using the 'create.project()' function.

For more details about ProjectTemplate, see http://projecttemplate.net

To automatically load this project, one must `setwd()` into the directory
where this README file is located. Then one must run the following two
lines of R code:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

Or one may enter 'source('startup.R')' for the same effect.

After these lines of code have been entered, one will see a series of automated
messages as ProjectTemplate goes about doing its work. This work involves:
* Reading in the global configuration file contained in `config`.
* Loading the R packages listed in the configuration file.
* Reading in any datasets stored in `data` or `cache`.
* Preprocessing the data using the files in the `munge` directory.

Once that's done, you can execute any code you'd like. For every analysis
one creates, the script should be saved as an .R file in the `src` directory.
